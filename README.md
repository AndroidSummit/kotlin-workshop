# Kotlin Workshop

This workshop will have you build a modern notepad app using the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language. 

It will also lean on other modern tools such as [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html) for persistence, 
[RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) for observing, 
and [ThreeTenABP](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP) for date handling.

### Preparation
Before the session begins, please install [Android Studio 3.0 Beta 2](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive.html) and make sure this repo builds successfully.
